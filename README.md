Create an English to Spanish dictionary. Provide the options below:
```
Press 1 to list all English to Spanish translations, press 2 to list all Spanish to English translations, press 3 to enter a new English translation, press 4 to enter a new Spanish translation, and press 5 or 'q' to quit.
```
Use an array for the English translation and a different one for the Spanish translation. Make sure both arrays are outside of the main function so it can be accessed anywhere in the program. Each word in the array should corrispond with the same word/index of the other array.

To work as a group, have one person clone the repo first, include the .gitignore file, push, then the other person clone the repo. Each person should create their own JavaScript file and put them in the index.html file. The main.js file, should have very little code in it. It should be mostly comprised of functions. If you want to use a function, make sure it's JavaScript file is ABOVE the one you're coding in. Example:

``` javascript
<script type="text/javascript" src="person1.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="person2.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="main.js"></script>
```

### Challenge
Create a sixth option that will search for an English word and give you the Spanish translation. It should work with the entire word, doesn't need to be a partial word find (that will make it a little harder).
